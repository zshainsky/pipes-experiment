Godot experiments for a new game called Pipes

# What is this repo about
[Experimenting with different ways to animate 2d water through a pipe](https://forum.godotengine.org/t/ideas-for-animating-water-flowing-through-pipes/112876)

# 3 ways to solve this
1. Animation player using a progression of sprite images as the pipe fills up. I had to create each sprite in a separate image editing tool.

3. Draw polyline of all the points along the curve of the pipe [helpful link]([url](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.html#quadratic-bezier))
4. Use a Shader to reveal an invisible texture along the points in the curve of the pipe
